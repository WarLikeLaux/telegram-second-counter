## Overview

**Telegram Timer Bot** is a utility designed to create a countdown timer right within a Telegram chat. Using a simple textual interface, users can set timers, and the bot notifies them about the progress with a visual progress bar and also sends a notification when the time runs out.

## Features

- **Visual Progress Indicator:** with the `render_progressbar` function, users get a graphical representation of the remaining time.
- **Real-time Notifications:** the `notify_progress` function updates the timer message in the chat, providing the current progress and sends a message when the time is up.
- **Pytimeparse Integration:** allows users to set time in various formats, e.g., "2h15m" or "90s".
- **Modularity and Clean Code:** functions like `start_notify_progress` and `notify_progress` ensure clarity and ease of code perception.
- **Integration with ptbot library:** for convenient interaction with the Telegram API.
- **Environment Variable Usage:** secure API key storage using `dotenv`.

Once you've done this, add or/and fill the following lines by values in your `.env` file:
